    <h3>About Our Mission</h3>
    <p>At Green Earth Foundation, our mission is simple yet urgent: <b>to protect our planet from the growing threat of plastic pollution.</b> Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter our oceans, harming marine life, contaminating food chains, and endangering future generations.

We believe that <b>change begins with awareness, and awareness leads to action.</b> Through community clean-up drives, education programs, recycling initiatives, and global campaigns, we are working to turn the tide against plastic.

Our mission is not just about removing waste ‚Äî it‚Äôs about <b>restoring balance between people and nature</b>, creating a world where the ocean thrives, wildlife flourishes, and humans live in harmony with the environment.

<br><br><i>üå± Together, we can build a future free from plastic pollution ‚Äî because protecting nature means protecting ourselves.</i></p>
